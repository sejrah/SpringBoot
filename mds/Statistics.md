Probability
	Helps determine distribution of random variables (discrete and continuous), create random samples for analysis, perform experiments
	Correlation is not Causation
	Random Variable is must to understand probability
	Hyphothesis test fails doesn't mean null hypothesis is true

Random Variable
	Assigns a numerical value to each possible outcome of a random experiment
	Not random variable: Today's weather (because it can be cloudy, rainy), color of car chosen, result of coin flip, price of the stock yesterday
	Random variable: the number of millimeters of rainfall tomorrow in Redmond, for car color with assigned value (1=blue, 2= green), for coin flip (1=head, 0=tail), price of the stock tomorrow, the number of laps between yellow flags in an F1 race
	Types of Random Variable: Discrete and Continuous
	
Discrete Random Variable
	Roll of a Die
	Probability Mass Function (table below):
	Outcome (x)	Probability (p)	P(X=x)=p
	1			1/6				P(X=1)=1/6
	2			1/6				P(X=2)=1/6
	3			1/6				P(X=3)=1/6
	4			1/6				P(X=4)=1/6
	5			1/6				P(X=5)=1/6
	6			1/6				P(X=6)=1/6
	

	X		random variable, the value on the die when you roll it
	x		outcome		
	P(X=x) Probability that X will have outcome x
	Sum of all probabilities must be 1
	
	Summerization of Distributions:
	Mean (aka expectation) - measure of centrality for PMF
	Variance - mean of the squared (not absolute) differences from the mean outcome
	Standard Deviation - square root of Variance
	
	Special Propability Distributions: Bernoulli, Binomial

Probability Distribution Function
Cummulative Distribution FunctionCentral Limit Theorem

Descriptive Statistics (Visual): Histogram, Bar Chart, Pareto Chart, Scatter Plot
Summary Statistics (Numerical): Sample Mean (vs. Populative Mean), Quantiles and Percentiles, Sample Median, Sample Variance, 5 Number Summary, Box Plot

Z-Scores
	Number of standard deviations above or below the mean
	Where a point is, relative to other points in distribution
