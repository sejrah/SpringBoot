Quantia Analytics, LLC
Descriptive vs Predictive vs. Prescriptive Analysis

4th wave: Artificial Intelligence, Nanotechnology and Biotechnology, Machine Learning, Data analytics
Education -> Science and Math

Obsolete jobs: Repetitive workers, Middle man (brokers, agents, tellers a.k.a. friction of capitalism), search engine jobs like paralegal in law firms

Future jobs: Weakness in Robots and computers -> Robots weak in pattern recognitions -> Non repetitive and semi-skilled jobs (Gardner, Construction, Police, Sanitation), lawyer

Commodity capital replaced by intellectual capital -> coal to rock and roll

What is it?
	Exploration and Quantitative analysis of
	Structured and Unstructured data to
	Develop Understanding, Extract Knowledge, and Formulate Actionable results

What is goal?
	Using Data to make Decisions that drive Actions.
	Replace intuition with data drive analytical decisions
	Transform data into Intellectual Property asset i.e. to derive value
	Increase pace of action

What it’s not? Retrospective Analysis like Business Intelligence (What happened, where are we) or Root Cause Analysis (Why did it happen)

What it is? Predictive Analysis (What will happen), Real-time Analysis (What should I do), Machine Learning (interact with ML System in real time)

Involves: Find data sources, Acquire data, Cleaning and Transform data, Understanding relationship in data, Presenting results, Deliver value from data

Process: It’s iterative process with following activities: Data selection, Preprocessing, Transformation, Data mining, Interpretation and evaluation

CCC Big Data Pipeline:
	Acquisition/Recording, Extraction/Cleaning/Annotation, Integration/Aggregation/Representation, Analysis/Modeling, Interpretation
	Big Data needs: Heterogeneity, Scale, Timeliness, Privacy, Human Collaboration
	
KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) Process:
	Selection, Preprocessing, Transformation, Data Mining, Interpretation/Evaluation

CRISP-DM (CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining):
	Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Interpretation, Modeling, Evaluation, Deployment
	Business Understanding: What do you really want to accomplish? What are the constraints? What are the risks? How will you evaluate the quality of the results?
	Modeling: Predictive modeling mostly mean machine learning or statistical modeling
	
Problem types: Classification, Regression (e.g. future demand), Clustering (e.g. Loyal, Somewhat Loyal, and likely to Switch), Recommendation

Classification algorithms: Regression, Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree, Multiclass Decision Jungle, One-vs-All Multiclass
Regression algorithms: Bayesian Linear Regression, Boosted Decision Tree Regression, Neural Network Regression
Clustering algorithms: K-Mans clustering

Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
Supervised Learning - you know what target value you are trying to predict (target value is contained in historical data); Classification and Regression algorithms
Unsupervised Learning - you don't know what target values you are looking for; Clustering algorithms

Model building is predictive, Policy Construction is prescriptive
