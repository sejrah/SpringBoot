Quantia Analytics, LLC
Descriptive vs Predictive vs. Prescriptive Analysis
4th wave: Artificial Intelligence, Nanotechnology and Biotechnology, Machine Learning, Data analytics
Education -> Science and Math

Obsolete jobs: Repetitive workers, Middle man (brokers, agents, tellers a.k.a. friction of capitalism), search engine jobs like paralegal in law firms

Future jobs: Weakness in Robots and computers -> Robots weak in pattern recognitions -> Non repetitive and semi-skilled jobs (Gardner, Construction, Police, Sanitation), lawyer

Commodity capital replaced by intellectual capital -> coal to rock and roll

Data Science skills: Python, R, SQL, NoSQL, Git, Spark, Hadoop, UNIX, Excel, Tableau

What is it?
Exploration and Quantitative analysis of
Structured and Unstructured data to
	Develop Understanding, Extract Knowledge, and Formulate Actionable results
What is goal? Using Data to make Decisions that drive Actions.
Replace intuition with data drive analytical decisions
Transform data into Intellectual Property asset i.e. to derive value
	Increase pace of action
What it’s not? Retrospective Analysis like Business Intelligence (What happened, where are we) or Root Cause Analysis (Why did it happen)
What it is? Predictive Analysis (What will happen), Real-time Analysis (What should I do), Machine Learning (interact with ML System in real time)
Involves:
	Find data sources
	Acquire data
	Cleaning and Transform data
	Understanding relationship in data
	Presenting results
	Deliver value from data
Process: It’s iterative process with following activities:
